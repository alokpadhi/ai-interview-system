Labeled data indicates that the\\xa0input data has already been tagged with the appropriate output. Basically, it is the task of learning a function that maps the input set and returns an output. Some of its examples are: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.\\n\\nk-Nearest Neighbors(KNN):Looking at the k closest labeled data points \\n\\n<br/>\\n',\n",
       " '## Linear regression\\n\\n**What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem? 👶**\\n\\nRegression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models investigate the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor).\\nHere are some common regression models\\n\\n- *Linear Regression* establishes a linear relationship between target and predictor (s). It predicts a numeric value and has a shape of a straight line.\\n- *Polynomial Regression* has a regression equation with the power of independent variable more than 1. It is a curve that fits into the data points.\\n- *Ridge Regression* helps when predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity problem). It penalizes the squares of regression coefficients but doesn’t allow the coefficients to reach zeros (uses L2 regularization).\\n- *Lasso Regression* penalizes the absolute values of regression coefficients and allows some of the coefficients to reach absolute zero (thereby allowing feature selection).\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is linear regression? When do we use it? 👶**\\n\\nLinear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).\\n\\nWith a simple equation:\\n\\n```\\ny = B0 + B1*x1 + ... + Bn * xN\\n```\\n\\nB is regression coefficients, x values are the independent (explanatory) variables  and y is dependent variable.\\n\\nThe case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.\\n\\nSimple linear regression:\\n\\n```\\ny = B0 + B1*x1\\n```\\n\\nMultiple linear regression:\\n\\n```\\ny = B0 + B1*x1 + ... + Bn * xN\\n```\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are the main assumptions of linear regression? ⭐**\\n\\nThere are several assumptions of linear regression. If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading.\\n\\n1. **Linear relationship** between features and target variable.\\n2. **Additivity** means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items _a_ sold and the number of items _b_ sold. When company sells more items _a_ the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items _b_ sold. But, if customers who buy _a_ stop buying _b_, the additivity assumption is violated.\\n3. Features are not correlated (no **collinearity**) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable.\\n4. Errors are independently and identically normally distributed (y<sub>i</sub> = B0 + B1*x1<sub>i</sub> + ... + error<sub>i</sub>):\\n   1. No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data).\\n   2. Constant variance of errors - **homoscedasticity**. For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity.\\n   3. Errors are normally distributed, otherwise some features will have more influence on the target variable than to others. If the error distribution is significantly non-normal, confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s the normal distribution? Why do we care about it? 👶**\\n\\nThe normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose probability density function takes the following formula:\\n\\n![formula](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/NormalDistribution/NumberedEquation1.gif)\\n\\nwhere μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.\\n\\nThe normal distribution derives its importance from the **Central Limit Theorem**, which states that if we draw a large enough number of samples, their mean will follow a normal distribution regardless of the initial distribution of the sample, i.e **the distribution of the mean of the samples is normal**. It is important that each sample is independent from the other.\\n\\nThis is powerful because it helps us study processes whose population distribution is unknown to us.\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we check if a variable follows the normal distribution? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\n1. Plot a histogram out of the sampled data. If you can fit the bell-shaped \"normal\" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected.\\n2. Check Skewness and Kurtosis of the sampled data. Skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 are typical for a normal distribution, so the farther away they are from these values, the more non-normal the distribution.\\n3. Use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or/and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality. They take into account both Skewness and Kurtosis simultaneously.\\n4. Check for Quantile-Quantile plot. It is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. Normal Q-Q plot place the data points in a roughly straight line.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What if we want to build a model for predicting prices? Are prices distributed normally? Do we need to do any pre-processing for prices? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nData is not normal. Specially, real-world datasets or uncleaned datasets always have certain skewness. Same goes for the price prediction. Price of houses or any other thing under consideration depends on a number of factors. So, there\\'s a great chance of presence of some skewed values i.e outliers if we talk in data science terms. \\n\\nYes, you may need to do pre-processing. Most probably, you will need to remove the outliers to make your distribution near-to-normal.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What methods for solving linear regression do you know? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nTo solve linear regression, you need to find the coefficients $`\\\\beta`$ which minimize the sum of squared errors.\\n\\nMatrix Algebra method: Let\\'s say you have `X`, a matrix of features, and `y`, a vector with the values you want to predict. After going through the matrix algebra and minimization problem, you get this solution: $`\\\\beta = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y`$. \\n\\nBut solving this requires you to find an inverse, which can be time-consuming, if not impossible. Luckily, there are methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR Decomposition that can reliably calculate this part $`(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}`$ (called the pseudo-inverse) without actually needing to find an inverse. The popular python ML library `sklearn` uses SVD to solve least squares.\\n\\nAlternative method: Gradient Descent. See explanation below.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is gradient descent? How does it work? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nGradient descent is an algorithm that uses calculus concept of gradient to try and reach local or global minima. It works by taking the negative of the gradient in a point of a given function, and updating that point repeatedly using the calculated negative gradient, until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, which will cause future iterations of the algorithm to return values that are equal or too close to the current point. It is widely used in machine learning applications.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the normal equation? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nNormal equations are equations obtained by setting equal to zero the partial derivatives of the sum of squared errors (least squares); normal equations allow one to estimate the parameters of a multiple linear regression.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is SGD \\u200a—\\u200a stochastic gradient descent? What’s the difference with the usual gradient descent? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIn both gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), you update a set of parameters in an iterative manner to minimize an error function.\\n\\nThe difference lies in how the gradient of the loss function is estimated. In the usual GD, you have to run through ALL the samples in your training set in order to estimate the gradient and do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration. In SGD, on the other hand, you use ONLY ONE or SUBSET of training sample from your training set to estimate the gradient and do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. If you use SUBSET, it is called Minibatch Stochastic gradient Descent.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Which metrics for evaluating regression models do you know? 👶**\\n\\n1. Mean Squared Error(MSE)\\n2. Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)\\n3. Mean Absolute Error(MAE)\\n4. R² or Coefficient of Determination\\n5. Adjusted R²\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are MSE and RMSE? 👶**\\n\\nMSE stands for <strong>M</strong>ean <strong>S</strong>quare <strong>E</strong>rror while RMSE stands for <strong>R</strong>oot <strong>M</strong>ean <strong>S</strong>quare <strong>E</strong>rror. They are metrics with which we can evaluate models.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the bias-variance trade-off? 👶**\\n\\n**Bias** is the error introduced by approximating the true underlying function, which can be quite complex, by a simpler model. **Variance** is a model sensitivity to changes in the training dataset.\\n\\n**Bias-variance trade-off** is a relationship between the expected test error and the variance and the bias - both contribute to the level of the test error and ideally should be as small as possible:\\n\\n```\\nExpectedTestError = Variance + Bias² + IrreducibleError\\n```\\n\\nBut as a model complexity increases, the bias decreases and the variance increases which leads to *overfitting*. And vice versa, model simplification helps to decrease the variance but it increases the bias which leads to *underfitting*.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",
       " '## Validation\\n\\n**What is overfitting? 👶**\\n\\nWhen your model perform very well on your training set but can\\'t generalize the test set, because it adjusted a lot to the training set.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How to validate your models? 👶**\\n\\nOne of the most common approaches is splitting data into train, validation and test parts.\\nModels are trained on train data, hyperparameters (for example early stopping) are selected based on the validation data, the final measurement is done on test dataset.\\nAnother approach is cross-validation: split dataset into K folds and each time train models on training folds and measure the performance on the validation folds.\\nAlso you could combine these approaches: make a test/holdout dataset and do cross-validation on the rest of the data. The final quality is measured on test dataset.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Why do we need to split our data into three parts: train, validation, and test? 👶**\\n\\nThe training set is used to fit the model, i.e. to train the model with the data. The validation set is then used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model while fine-tuning hyperparameters. This improves the generalization of the model. Finally, a test data set which the model has never \"seen\" before should be used for the final evaluation of the model. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model. The evaluation should never be performed on the same data that is used for training. Otherwise the model performance would not be representative.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Can you explain how cross-validation works? 👶**\\n\\nCross-validation is the process to separate your total training set into two subsets: training and validation set, and evaluate your model to choose the hyperparameters. But you do this process iteratively, selecting different training and validation set, in order to reduce the bias that you would have by selecting only one validation set.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is K-fold cross-validation? 👶**\\n\\nK fold cross validation is a method of cross validation where we select a hyperparameter k. The dataset is now divided into k parts. Now, we take the 1st part as validation set and remaining k-1 as training set. Then we take the 2nd part as validation set and remaining k-1 parts as training set. Like this, each part is used as validation set once and the remaining k-1 parts are taken together and used as training set.\\nIt should not be used in a time series data.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we choose K in K-fold cross-validation? What’s your favorite K? 👶**\\n\\nThere are two things to consider while deciding K: the number of models we get and the size of validation set. We do not want the number of models to be too less, like 2 or 3. At least 4 models give a less biased decision on the metrics. On the other hand, we would want the dataset to be at least 20-25% of the entire data. So that at least a ratio of 3:1 between training and validation set is maintained. <br/>\\nI tend to use 4 for small datasets and 5 for large ones as K.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",
       " '## Classification\\n\\n**What is classification? Which models would you use to solve a classification problem? 👶**\\n\\nClassification problems are problems in which our prediction space is discrete, i.e. there is a finite number of values the output variable can be. Some models which can be used to solve classification problems are: logistic regression, decision tree, random forests, multi-layer perceptron, one-vs-all, amongst others.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is logistic regression? When do we need to use it? 👶**\\n\\nLogistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that is used for binary classification. You should use logistic regression when your Y variable takes only two values, e.g. True and False, \"spam\" and \"not spam\", \"churn\" and \"not churn\" and so on. The variable is said to be a \"binary\" or \"dichotomous\".\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Is logistic regression a linear model? Why? 👶**\\n\\nYes, Logistic Regression is considered a generalized linear model because the outcome always depends on the sum of the inputs and parameters. Or in other words, the output cannot depend on the product (or quotient, etc.) of its parameters.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is sigmoid? What does it do? 👶**\\n\\nA sigmoid function is a type of activation function, and more specifically defined as a squashing function. Squashing functions limit the output to a range between 0 and 1, making these functions useful in the prediction of probabilities.\\n\\nSigmod(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we evaluate classification models? 👶**\\n\\nDepending on the classification problem, we can use the following evaluation metrics:\\n\\n1. Accuracy\\n2. Precision\\n3. Recall\\n4. F1 Score\\n5. Logistic loss (also known as Cross-entropy loss)\\n6. Jaccard similarity coefficient score\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is accuracy? 👶**\\n\\nAccuracy is a metric for evaluating classification models. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Is accuracy always a good metric? 👶**\\n\\nAccuracy is not a good performance metric when there is imbalance in the dataset. For example, in binary classification with 95% of A class and 5% of B class, a constant prediction of A class would have an accuracy of 95%. In case of imbalance dataset, we need to choose Precision, recall, or F1 Score depending on the problem we are trying to solve.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the confusion table? What are the cells in this table? 👶**\\n\\nConfusion table (or confusion matrix) shows how many True positives (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) model has made.\\n\\n||                |     Actual   |        Actual |\\n|:---:|   :---:        |     :---:    |:---:          |\\n||                | Positive (1) | Negative (0)  |\\n|Predicted|   Positive (1) | TP           | FP            |\\n|Predicted|   Negative (0) | FN           | TN            |\\n\\n* True Positives (TP): When the actual class of the observation is 1 (True) and the prediction is 1 (True)\\n* True Negative (TN): When the actual class of the observation is 0 (False) and the prediction is 0 (False)\\n* False Positive (FP): When the actual class of the observation is 0 (False) and the prediction is 1 (True)\\n* False Negative (FN): When the actual class of the observation is 1 (True) and the prediction is 0 (False)\\n\\nMost of the performance metrics for classification models are based on the values of the confusion matrix.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are precision, recall, and F1-score? 👶**\\n\\n* Precision and recall are classification evaluation metrics:\\n* P = TP / (TP + FP) and R = TP / (TP + FN).\\n* Where TP is true positives, FP is false positives and FN is false negatives\\n* In both cases the score of 1 is the best: we get no false positives or false negatives and only true positives.\\n* F1 is a combination of both precision and recall in one score (harmonic mean):\\n* F1 = 2 * PR / (P + R).\\n* Max F score is 1 and min is 0, with 1 being the best.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Precision-recall trade-off \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nTradeoff means increasing one parameter would lead to decreasing of other. Precision-recall tradeoff occur due to increasing one of the parameter(precision or recall) while keeping the model same. \\n\\nIn an ideal scenario where there is a perfectly separable data, both precision and recall can get maximum value of 1.0. But in most of the practical situations, there is noise in the dataset and the dataset is not perfectly separable. There might be some points of positive class closer to the negative class and vice versa. In such cases, shifting the decision boundary can either increase the precision or recall but not both. Increasing one parameter leads to decreasing of the other. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the ROC curve? When to use it? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nROC stands for *Receiver Operating Characteristics*. The diagrammatic representation that shows the contrast between true positive rate vs false positive rate. It is used when we need to predict the probability of the binary outcome.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is AUC (AU ROC)? When to use it? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAUC stands for *Area Under the ROC Curve*. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It\\'s used when we need to value how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes.  The value is between 0 and 1, the higher the better.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How to interpret the AU ROC score? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAUC score is the value of *Area Under the ROC Curve*. \\n\\nIf we assume ROC curve consists of dots, $`(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\\\cdots, (x_m,y_m)`$, then\\n\\n$`AUC = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}(x_{i+1}-x_i)\\\\cdot (y_i+y_{i+1})`$\\n\\nAn excellent model has AUC near to the 1 which means it has good measure of separability. A poor model has AUC near to the 0 which means it has worst measure of separability. When AUC score is 0.5, it means model has no class separation capacity whatsoever. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the PR (precision-recall) curve? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nA *precision*-*recall curve* (or PR Curve) is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different probability thresholds. Precision-recall curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains where ROC curves may provide an excessively optimistic view of the performance.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is the area under the PR curve? Is it a useful metric? \\u200d⭐️I**\\n\\nThe Precision-Recall AUC is just like the ROC AUC, in that it summarizes the curve with a range of threshold values as a single score.\\n\\nA high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**In which cases AU PR is better than AU ROC? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nWhat is different however is that AU ROC looks at a true positive rate TPR and false positive rate FPR while AU PR looks at positive predictive value PPV and true positive rate TPR.\\n\\nTypically, if true negatives are not meaningful to the problem or you care more about the positive class, AU PR is typically going to be more useful; otherwise, If you care equally about the positive and negative class or your dataset is quite balanced, then going with AU ROC is a good idea.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What do we do with categorical variables? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nCategorical variables must be encoded before they can be used as features to train a machine learning model. There are various encoding techniques, including:\\n- One-hot encoding\\n- Label encoding\\n- Ordinal encoding\\n- Target encoding\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Why do we need one-hot encoding? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIf we simply encode categorical variables with a Label encoder, they become ordinal which can lead to undesirable consequences. In this case, linear models will treat category with id 4 as twice better than a category with id 2. One-hot encoding allows us to represent a categorical variable in a numerical vector space which ensures that vectors of each category have equal distances between each other. This approach is not suited for all situations, because by using it with categorical variables of high cardinality (e.g. customer id) we will encounter problems that come into play because of the curse of dimensionality.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is \"curse of dimensionality\"? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThe curse of dimensionality is an issue that arises when working with high-dimensional data. It is often said that \"the curse of dimensionality\" is one of the main problems with machine learning. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that, as the number of dimensions (features) in a data set increases, the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between those features increases exponentially.\\n\\nA simple example where we have a data set with two features, x1 and x2. If we want to learn the relationship between these two features, we need to have enough data points so that we can accurately estimate the parameters of that relationship. However, if we add a third feature, x3, then the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between all three features increases exponentially. This is because there are now more parameters to estimate, and the number of data points needed to accurately estimate those parameters increases exponentially with the number of parameters.\\n\\nSimply put, the curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"## Regularization\\n\\n**What happens to our linear regression model if we have three columns in our data: x, y, z \\u200a—\\u200a and z is a sum of x and y? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nWe would not be able to perform the regression. Because z is linearly dependent on x and y so when performing the regression $`{X}^{T}{X}`$ would be a singular (not invertible) matrix.\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What happens to our linear regression model if the column z in the data is a sum of columns x and y and some random noise? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIt creates a situation known as multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, leading to issues in the estimation of the regression coefficients. The issue arises because the variables X and Y will be highly correlated, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the individual effects of X and Y on the dependent variable Z. To address it, feature selection, PCA or regularization techniques (L2) may be used.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is regularization? Why do we need it? 👶**\\n\\nRegularization is used to reduce overfitting in machine learning models. It helps the models to generalize well and make them robust to outliers and noise in the data.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Which regularization techniques do you know? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThere are mainly two types of regularization,\\n1. L1 Regularization (Lasso regularization) - Adds the sum of absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function. $`\\\\lambda\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\left | w_i \\\\right |`$\\n2. L2 Regularization (Ridge regularization) - Adds the sum of squares of coefficients to the cost function. $`\\\\lambda\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {w_{i}}^{2}`$\\n\\n* Where $`\\\\lambda`$ determines the amount of regularization.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What kind of regularization techniques are applicable to linear models? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAIC/BIC, Ridge regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, Basis pursuit denoising, Rudin–Osher–Fatemi model (TV), Potts model, RLAD,\\nDantzig Selector,SLOPE\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How does L2 regularization look like in a linear model? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nL2 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of squares of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. This technique makes sure that the coefficients are close to zero and is widely used in cases when we have a lot of features that might correlate with each other.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we select the right regularization parameters? 👶**\\n\\nRegularization parameters can be chosen using a grid search, for example https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html has one formula for the implementing for regularization, alpha in the formula mentioned can be found by doing a RandomSearch or a GridSearch on a set of values and selecting the alpha which gives the least cross validation or validation error.\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s the effect of L2 regularization on the weights of a linear model? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nL2 regularization penalizes larger weights more severely (due to the squared penalty term), which encourages weight values to decay toward zero.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How L1 regularization looks like in a linear model? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nL1 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of modules of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. For example, cost function with L1 regularization will look like: $`\\\\sum_{i=0}^{N} (y_i - \\\\sum_{j=0}^{M} x_{ij} * w_j)+\\\\lambda\\\\sum_{j=0}^{M} \\\\left | w_j \\\\right |`$\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s the difference between L2 and L1 regularization? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\n- Penalty terms: L1 regularization uses the sum of the absolute values of the weights, while L2 regularization uses the sum of the weights squared.\\n- Feature selection: L1 performs feature selection by reducing the coefficients of some predictors to 0, while L2 does not.\\n- Computational efficiency: L2 has an analytical solution, while L1 does not.\\n- Multicollinearity: L2 addresses multicollinearity by constraining the coefficient norm.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Can we have both L1 and L2 regularization components in a linear model? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nYes, elastic net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s the interpretation of the bias term in linear models? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nBias is simply, a difference between predicted value and actual/true value.

But dont get confused between accuracy and bias.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we interpret weights in linear models? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nWithout normalizing weights or variables, if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the coefficient represents on average how much the output changes. By the way, this interpretation still works for logistic regression - if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the weight represents the change in the log of the odds.\\n\\nIf the variables are normalized, we can interpret weights in linear models like the importance of this variable in the predicted result.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**If a weight for one variable is higher than for another \\u200a—\\u200a can we say that this variable is more important? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nYes - if your predictor variables are normalized.\\n\\nWithout normalization, the weight represents the change in the output per unit change in the predictor. If you have a predictor with a huge range and scale that is used to predict an output with a very small range - for example, using each nation's GDP to predict maternal mortality rates - your coefficient should be very small. That does not necessarily mean that this predictor variable is not important compared to the others.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**When do we need to perform feature normalization for linear models? When it’s okay not to do it? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nFeature normalization is necessary for L1 and L2 regularizations. The idea of both methods is to penalize all the features relatively equally. This can't be done effectively if every feature is scaled differently. \\n\\nLinear regression without regularization techniques can be used without feature normalization. Also, regularization can help to make the analytical solution more stable, — it adds the regularization matrix to the feature matrix before inverting it. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n\",\n",

Hence, there is no hard thumb rule in deciding the depth, but literature suggests a few tips on tuning the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting:\\n\\n- limit the maximum depth of a tree\\n- limit the number of test nodes\\n- limit the minimum number of objects at a node required to split\\n- do not split a node when, at least, one of the resulting subsample sizes is below a given threshold\\n- stop developing a node if it does not sufficiently improve the fit.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How do we know how many trees we need in random forest? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThe number of trees in random forest is worked by n_estimators, and a random forest reduces overfitting by increasing the number of trees. There is no fixed thumb rule to decide the number of trees in a random forest, it is rather fine tuned with the data, typically starting off by taking the square of the number of features (n) present in the data followed by tuning until we get the optimal results.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Is it easy to parallelize training of a random forest model?

This can be a problem when you need to make predictions in real-time or on a large dataset.\\n\\n- Memory consumption: Random Forest models with many large trees can consume a lot of memory, which can be a problem when working with large datasets or on a limited hardware.\\n\\n- Lack of interpretability: Random Forest models with many large trees can be difficult to interpret, making it harder to understand how the model is making predictions or what features are most important.\\n\\n- Difficulty in tuning : With an increasing number of large trees the tuning process becomes more complex and computationally expensive.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to keep in mind that the number of trees in a Random Forest should be chosen based on the specific problem and dataset, rather than using a large number of trees by default. In practice, the number of trees in a random forest is chosen based on the trade-off between the computational cost and the performance.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What if instead of finding the best split, we randomly select a few splits and just select the best from them.

       " '## Parameter tuning\\n\\n**Which hyper-parameter tuning strategies (in general) do you know? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThere are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:\\n* <b>Grid Search</b> is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to <i>manually</i> give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it\\'s easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.\\n\\n* <b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.\\n\\n* In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"simple\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i>acquisition function</i> intelligently chooses (using a <i>surrogate function</i> such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s the difference between grid search parameter tuning strategy and random search?

Some good examples are problems that are relatively easy for humans (because of experience, intuition, understanding, etc), but difficult for traditional regression models: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, image identification, etc.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How does a usual fully-connected feed-forward neural network work? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIn a usual fully-connected feed-forward network, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer and thus the receptive field of a neuron is the entire previous layer. They are usually used to represent feature vectors for input data in classification problems but can be expensive to train because of the number of computations involved.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Why do we need activation functions? 👶**\\n\\nThe main idea of using neural networks is to learn complex nonlinear functions. If we are not using an activation function in between different layers of a neural network, we are just stacking up multiple linear layers one on top of another and this leads to learning a linear function. The Nonlinearity comes only with the activation function, this is the reason we need activation functions.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are the problems with sigmoid as an activation function? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThe derivative of the sigmoid function for large positive or negative numbers is almost zero. From this comes the problem of vanishing gradient — during the backpropagation our net will not learn (or will learn drastically slow). One possible way to solve this problem is to use ReLU activation function.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is ReLU? How is it better than sigmoid or tanh? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nReLU is an abbreviation for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an activation function which has the value 0 for all negative values and the value f(x) = x for all positive values. The ReLU has a simple activation function which makes it fast to compute and while the sigmoid and tanh activation functions saturate at higher values, the ReLU has a potentially infinite activation, which addresses the problem of vanishing gradients. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How we can initialize the weights of a neural network? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nProper initialization of weight matrix in neural network is very necessary.\\nSimply we can say there are two ways for initializations.\\n   1. Initializing weights with zeroes.\\n      Setting weights to zero makes your network no better than a linear model. It is important to note that setting biases to 0 will not create any troubles as non zero weights take care of breaking the symmetry and even if bias is 0, the values in every neuron are still different.  \\n   2. Initializing weights randomly.\\n      Assigning random values to weights is better than just 0 assignment. \\n* a) If weights are initialized with very high values the term np.dot(W,X)+b becomes significantly higher and if an activation function like sigmoid() is applied, the function maps its value near to 1 where the slope of gradient changes slowly and learning takes a lot of time.\\n* b) If weights are initialized with low values it gets mapped to 0, where the case is the same as above. This problem is often referred to as the vanishing gradient.\\n      \\n<br/>\\n\\n**What if we set all the weights of a neural network to 0? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIf all the weights of a neural network are set to zero, the output of each connection is same (W*x = 0). This means the gradients which are backpropagated to each connection in a layer is same. This means all the connections/weights learn the same thing, and the model never converges. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What regularization techniques for neural nets do you know? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\n* L1 Regularization - Defined as the sum of absolute values of the individual parameters. The L1 penalty causes a subset of the weights to become zero, suggesting that the corresponding features may safely be discarded. \\n* L2 Regularization - Defined as the sum of square of individual parameters. Often supported by regularization hyperparameter alpha. It results in weight decay. \\n* Data Augmentation - This requires some fake data to be created as a part of training set. \\n* Drop Out : This is most effective regularization technique for neural nets. Few random nodes in each layer is deactivated in forward pass. This allows the algorithm to train on different set of nodes in each iterations.\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is dropout? Why is it useful? How does it work? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nDropout is a technique that at each training step turns off each neuron with a certain probability of *p*. This way at each iteration we train only *1-p* of neurons, which forces the network not to rely only on the subset of neurons for feature representation. This leads to regularizing effects that are controlled by the hyperparameter *p*.  \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",

Too small? 👶**\\n\\nA large learning rate can accelerate the training. However, it is possible that we \"shoot\" too far and miss the minimum of the function that we want to optimize, which will not result in the best solution. On the other hand, training with a small learning rate takes more time but it is possible to find a more precise minimum.

There are many available techniques to do decay the learning rate.

You can learn about convolutions below. It appears that convolutions are quite powerful when it comes to working with images and videos due to their ability to extract and learn complex features. Thus CNN's are a go-to method for any problem in computer vision.    \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s a convolutional layer? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThe idea of the convolutional layer is the assumption that the information needed for making a decision often is spatially close and thus, it only takes the weighted sum over nearby inputs. It also assumes that the networks’ kernels can be reused for all nodes, hence the number of weights can be drastically reduced. To counteract only one feature being learnt per layer, multiple kernels are applied to the input which creates parallel channels in the output. Consecutive layers can also be stacked to allow the network to find more high-level features.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Why do we actually need convolutions? Can’t we use fully-connected layers for that? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nA fully-connected layer needs one weight per inter-layer connection, which means the number of weights which needs to be computed quickly balloons as the number of layers and nodes per layer is increased. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What’s pooling in CNN? Why do we need it? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nPooling is a technique to downsample the feature map. It allows layers which receive relatively undistorted versions of the input to learn low level features such as lines, while layers deeper in the model can learn more abstract features such as texture.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How does max pooling work? Are there other pooling techniques? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nMax pooling is a technique where the maximum value of a receptive field is passed on in the next feature map. The most commonly used receptive field is 2 x 2 with a stride of 2, which means the feature map is downsampled from N x N to N/2 x N/2. Receptive fields larger than 3 x 3 are rarely employed as too much information is lost. \\n\\nOther pooling techniques include:\\n\\n* Average pooling, the output is the average value of the receptive field.\\n* Min pooling, the output is the minimum value of the receptive field.\\n* Global pooling, where the receptive field is set to be equal to the input size, this means the output is equal to a scalar and can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Are CNNs resistant to rotations? What happens to the predictions of a CNN if an image is rotated? 🚀**\\n\\nCNNs are not resistant to rotation by design. However, we can make our models resistant by augmenting our datasets with different rotations of the raw data. The predictions of a CNN will change if an image is rotated and we did not augment our dataset accordingly. A demonstration of this occurence can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO1bQo4PXV4), where a CNN changes its predicted class between a duck and a rabbit based on the rotation of the image.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are augmentations?

It helps in diversifying the data and even increasing the data when there is scarcity of data for a model to train on.  \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What kind of augmentations do you know? 👶**\\n\\nThere are many kinds of augmentations which can be used according to the type of data you are working on some of which are geometric and numerical transformation, PCA, cropping, padding, shifting, noise injection etc.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How to choose which augmentations to use? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAugmentations really depend on the type of output classes and the features you want your model to learn.

How does it work? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nGiven a source domain D_S and learning task T_S, a target domain D_T and learning task T_T, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function f_T in D_T using the knowledge in D_S and T_S, where D_S ≠ D_T,or T_S ≠ T_T. In other words, transfer learning enables to reuse knowledge coming from other domains or learning tasks.\\n\\nIn the context of CNNs, we can use networks that were pre-trained on popular datasets such as ImageNet. We then can use the weights of the layers that learn to represent features and combine them with a new set of layers that learns to map the feature representations to the given classes.

       " '## Text classification\\n\\n**How can we use machine learning for text classification? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nMachine learning classification algorithms predict a class based on a numerical feature representation. This means that in order to use machine learning for text classification, we need to extract numerical features from our text data first before we can apply machine learning algorithms. Common approaches to extract numerical features from text data are bag of words, N-grams or word embeddings.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is bag of words? How we can use it for text classification? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nBag of Words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. The order or structure of the words is not considered. For text classification, we look at the histogram of the words within the text and consider each word count as a feature.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAdvantages:\\n1. Simple to understand and implement.\\n\\nDisadvantages:\\n1. The vocabulary requires careful design, most specifically in order to manage the size, which impacts the sparsity of the document representations.\\n2. Sparse representations are harder to model both for computational reasons (space and time complexity) and also for information reasons\\n3. Discarding word order ignores the context, and in turn meaning of words in the document. Context and meaning can offer a lot to the model, that if modeled could tell the difference between the same words differently arranged (“this is interesting” vs “is this interesting”), synonyms (“old bike” vs “used bike”).\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are N-grams? How can we use them? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nThe function to tokenize into consecutive sequences of words is called n-grams. It can be used to find out N most co-occurring words (how often word X is followed by word Y) in a given sentence.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How large should be N for our bag of words when using N-grams? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nAnswer here\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What is TF-IDF? How is it useful for text classification? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nTerm Frequency (TF) is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents. It is used in scenario where highly recurring words may not contain as much informational content as the domain specific words. For example, words like “the” that are frequent across all documents therefore need to be less weighted. The TF-IDF score highlights words that are distinct (contain useful information) in a given document.  \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Which model would you use for text classification with bag of words features? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\n1. Bag Of Words model\\n2. Word2Vec Embeddings\\n3. fastText Embeddings\\n4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\\n5. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\n6. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Would you prefer gradient boosting trees model or logistic regression when doing text classification with bag of words? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nUsually logistic regression is better because bag of words creates a matrix with large number of columns. For a huge number of columns logistic regression is usually faster than gradient boosting trees.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**What are word embeddings? Why are they useful? Do you know Word2Vec? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nWord Embeddings are vector representations for words. Each word is mapped to one vector, this vector tries to capture some characteristics of the word, allowing similar words to have similar vector representations.  \\nWord Embeddings helps in capturing the inter-word semantics and represents it in real-valued vectors.  \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nWord2Vec is a method to construct such an embedding. It takes a text corpus as input and outputs a set of vectors which represents words in that corpus.  \\n\\nIt can be generated using two methods:\\n\\n- Common Bag of Words (CBOW)\\n- Skip-Gram\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Do you know any other ways to get word embeddings? 🚀**\\n\\n- GloVe\\n- BERT\\n<br/>\\n\\n**If you have a sentence with multiple words, you may need to combine multiple word embeddings into one. How would you do it? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nApproaches ranked from simple to more complex:\\n\\n1. Take an average over all words\\n2. Take a weighted average over all words. Weighting can be done by inverse document frequency (idf part of tf-idf).\\n3. Use ML model like LSTM or Transformer.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**Would you prefer gradient boosting trees model or logistic regression when doing text classification with embeddings? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nGradient boosting trees (GBTs) are generally a better choice than logistic regression for text classification with embeddings. This is because GBTs are able to learn more complex relationships between the features in the data, including the features extracted from the embeddings.\\n\\nLogistic regression is a linear model, which means that it can only learn linear relationships between the features. This can be a limitation for text classification, where the relationships between the features are often complex and non-linear.\\n\\nGBTs, on the other hand, are able to learn non-linear relationships between the features by combining multiple decision trees. This allows GBTs to learn more complex patterns in the data, which can lead to better performance on text classification tasks.\\n\\nIn addition, GBTs are more robust to outliers and noise in the data than logistic regression. This can be important for text classification tasks, where the data can be noisy and imbalanced.\\n\\nOverall, GBTs are a better choice than logistic regression for text classification with embeddings, especially when the data is noisy or imbalanced. However, it is important to consider the computational cost and interpretability of GBTs before using them.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How can you use neural nets for text classification? 🚀**\\n\\nHere is a general overview of how to use neural nets for text classification:\\n\\nPreprocess the text: This includes cleaning the text by removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant symbols. It may also involve converting the text to lowercase and stemming or lemmatizing the words.\\nRepresent the text as a vector: This can be done using a variety of methods, such as one-hot encoding or word embeddings.\\nBuild the neural net: The neural net architecture will depend on the specific text classification task. However, a typical architecture will include an embedding layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.\\nTrain the neural net: The neural net is trained by feeding it labeled examples of text data. The neural net will learn to adjust its parameters in order to minimize the loss function, which is typically the cross-entropy loss function.\\nEvaluate the neural net: Once the neural net is trained, it can be evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance.\\nHere are some specific examples of how neural nets can be used for text classification:\\nSentiment analysis, Spam detection, Topic classification, Language identification\\n\\nNeural nets have achieved state-of-the-art results on many text classification tasks. However, they can be computationally expensive to train and deploy. \\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How can we use CNN for text classification? 🚀**\\n\\nHere are some specific examples of how CNNs can be used for text classification:\\n\\nSentiment analysis: CNNs can be used to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This is a common task in social media analysis and customer service.\\nSpam detection: CNNs can be used to classify emails as spam or not spam. This is a common task in email filtering systems.\\nTopic classification: CNNs can be used to classify text documents into different topics. This is a common task in news and social media analysis.\\nLanguage identification: CNNs can be used to identify the language of a text document. This is a common task in translation systems.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",

It is a special type of SVD where the singular values correspond to the eigenvectors and the values of the diagonal matrix are the squares of the eigenvalues. We use these features as they are statistically descriptive.\\n* Having calculated the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we can use the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, a scree plot or the proportion of explained variance to determine the principal components (i.e. the final dimensionality) that are useful for dimensionality reduction.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n',\n",

Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N * sum(v in U) r_vi.\\n* In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating.\\n* Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases.\\n* Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n**How we can incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, etc) into our recommender systems? \\u200d⭐️**\\n\\nIn comparison to explicit feedback, implicit feedback datasets lack negative examples.

One popular approach to solve this problem is named weighted alternating least squares (wALS) [Hu, Y., Koren, Y., & Volinsky, C. (2008, December). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In Data Mining, 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on (pp. 263-272). IEEE.].

Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it\\'s easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.\\n\\n* <b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.\\n\\n* In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly.

       "  'reference_answer': 'There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:\\n* <b>Grid Search</b> is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to <i>manually</i> give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it\\'s easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.\\n\\n* <b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.\\n\\n* In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"simple\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i>acquisition function</i> intelligently chooses (using a <i>surrogate function</i> such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.',\n",

This is because GBTs are able to learn more complex relationships between the features in the data, including the features extracted from the embeddings.\\n\\nLogistic regression is a linear model, which means that it can only learn linear relationships between the features. This can be a limitation for text classification, where the relationships between the features are often complex and non-linear.\\n\\nGBTs, on the other hand, are able to learn non-linear relationships between the features by combining multiple decision trees. This allows GBTs to learn more complex patterns in the data, which can lead to better performance on text classification tasks.\\n\\nIn addition, GBTs are more robust to outliers and noise in the data than logistic regression. This can be important for text classification tasks, where the data can be noisy and imbalanced.\\n\\nOverall, GBTs are a better choice than logistic regression for text classification with embeddings, especially when the data is noisy or imbalanced.

       "  'reference_answer': 'There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:\\n* <b>Grid Search</b> is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to <i>manually</i> give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it\\'s easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge.\\n\\n* <b>Random Search</b> is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored.\\n\\n* In a completely different framework, <b>Bayesian Optimization</b> is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a \"simple\" explanation is that a much simpler/faster <i>acquisition function</i> intelligently chooses (using a <i>surrogate function</i> such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.',\n",
